# Development Plan

**Last Updated:** April 11, 2025

This document outlines the plan for implementing features and functionality in the project, including milestones, tasks, and development approach.

## Development Approach

The multi-tenant website engine will be developed using a rolling development model rather than fixed sprints. This approach allows us to:

1. Continuously prioritize and pull in the most valuable work as we progress
2. Adapt quickly to changing requirements and discoveries
3. Deliver completed features as soon as they're ready rather than waiting for sprint boundaries
4. Maintain a clear view of priorities at all times through the Kanban board

We'll still focus on the core infrastructure components first (tenant resolution and configuration), followed by theming and content management, but with flexibility to adjust priorities as needed.

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
**Timeline:** May 1 - May 31, 2025
**Goal:** Implement the foundational multi-tenant framework and basic site serving capabilities

**Key Deliverables:**
- Next.js project setup with proper file structure
- Firestore integration and data model implementation
- Domain-based tenant resolution middleware
- Local caching mechanism for domain lookups
- Basic site context provider for tenant configuration
- Simple theming system with CSS variables

### Phase 2: Content Management & Rendering
**Timeline:** June 1 - June 30, 2025
**Goal:** Enable tenant-specific content management and presentation

**Key Deliverables:**
- Tenant-aware data repositories for content types
- Dynamic page rendering based on content types
- Component library with tenant styling
- Responsive layouts for different devices
- Basic SEO implementation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Refinement
**Timeline:** July 1 - July 31, 2025
**Goal:** Enhance the platform with advanced features and optimize performance

**Key Deliverables:**
- More sophisticated theming capabilities
- Performance optimizations for data fetching and rendering
- Error handling improvements
- Monitoring and analytics integration
- Documentation and deployment guides

## Current Sprint/Iteration

**Sprint/Iteration:** 1 - Foundation Setup
**Timeline:** May 1 - May 14, 2025
**Goal:** Establish the Next.js project structure and implement basic tenant resolution

### Active Tasks
1. Project structure setup and dependency installation - Sarah - May 3
2. Firestore schema design and initialization scripts - Michael - May 5
3. Domain resolution middleware implementation - David - May 8
4. Site configuration context provider - Sarah - May 10
5. Basic theme implementation with CSS variables - Alex - May 12
6. Test harness for multi-tenant routing - Michael - May 14

### Dependencies
- Firestore schema design depends on finalizing the data model
- Site configuration context depends on domain resolution middleware
- Theme implementation depends on site configuration context

## Development Workflow

### Code Management
- **Branch Strategy:** Feature branches from `develop`, merge via PR, release branches from `develop` to `main`
- **Merge Process:** Code review required, passing tests, approved by at least one reviewer
- **Version Control:** Git with conventional commits format

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Jest for utility functions, services, and hooks
- **Integration Tests:** Testing Library for React components and pages
- **Manual Testing:** Test checklist for cross-browser and device compatibility

### Review Process
- **Code Review:** Pull request with at least one reviewer
- **Design Review:** UI components must match approved designs
- **QA Process:** Test plan execution and bug verification

## Implementation Details

### Tenant Resolution Implementation
**Approach:** Create a Next.js middleware that extracts the domain from the request and resolves it to a tenant configuration
**Key Components:**
- Middleware function to intercept requests
- Cache module for storing domain-to-tenant mappings
- Firestore query for tenant lookup by domain
- Context injection for downstream use

### Theming System Implementation
**Approach:** Use CSS variables defined at the document root level based on tenant configuration
**Key Components:**
- Theme provider component that sets CSS variables
- Firestore theme document structure
- Theme switching mechanism
- Component styles that reference CSS variables

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Firestore read limits exceeded | High | Medium | Implement aggressive caching, monitor usage, optimize queries |
| Performance issues with many tenants | High | Medium | Load testing, performance monitoring, optimization strategy |
| Security vulnerabilities between tenants | High | Low | Thorough security review, strict tenant isolation, penetration testing |
| Complex theming requirements | Medium | Medium | Start with simple theming system, gradually enhance capabilities |
| Deployment complexity | Medium | Medium | Detailed deployment documentation, CI/CD automation |
