## Development Domain Configuration

We've enhanced the repository pattern implementation to ensure seamless development experience by adding a default domain configuration for 'localhost:3000'. This ensures that developers can work locally without needing to set up specific domain mappings or mock data.

Implementation details:
1. Added a DEV_SITE constant with default configuration in SiteRepository and SiteContext
2. Updated SiteRepository to handle 'localhost:3000' as a special case in development mode
3. Modified middleware.ts to use default-tenant for localhost in development
4. Improved error fallbacks to gracefully handle errors in development by serving the default site
5. Added consistent fallback behavior to ensure a smooth development experience

These changes allow developers to:
- Work locally without any special configuration
- See consistent behavior on localhost:3000
- Test the multi-tenant functionality by using mock domains
- Get automatic fallback to the development site when errors occur

## Implementation of Repository Pattern for Tenant-Isolated Data Access

We successfully implemented the repository pattern for tenant-isolated data access with the following components:

1. **BaseRepository**: Created an abstract base class that provides common CRUD operations with automatic tenant filtering
   - All operations include tenant ID validation
   - Type-safe interfaces with TypeScript generics
   - Common error handling and logging

2. **TenantContext**: Implemented a singleton class to manage and access the current tenant ID
   - Works in both server-side and client-side contexts
   - Integrates with the middleware for automatic context initialization
   - Provides fallback mechanisms when tenant ID isn't explicitly set

3. **Specialized Repositories**:
   - **PageRepository**: Manages tenant-specific page content
   - **ThemeRepository**: Handles theme data with special handling for global resources
   - **SiteRepository**: Provides site configuration access

4. **Middleware Integration**:
   - Updated the tenant resolution middleware to use the repository pattern
   - Initializes the tenant context for each request

5. **SiteContext Integration**:
   - Updated SiteContext to use the repository pattern
   - Improved error handling and tenant ID resolution

This pattern now ensures that all data queries automatically include tenant filtering, which prevents accidental data leakage between tenants. It also provides a consistent interface for data access throughout the application, making the code more maintainable and testable.

The implementation has been documented in lib/repository/README.md, which includes usage examples and guidelines for adding new repositories.

## Create repository pattern for tenant-isolated data access

Creating a repository pattern for tenant-isolated data access means implementing a layer of abstraction that handles all data operations while automatically enforcing tenant isolation. This pattern will ensure that data queries are always filtered by the current tenant's ID, preventing accidental cross-tenant data access.

The implementation would involve:
1. Creating repository classes for each data type (pages, posts, products, etc.)
2. These repositories would encapsulate Firestore queries with automatic tenant filtering
3. All components would use these repositories instead of direct Firestore access
4. The repositories would automatically include the current tenant context in queries

This provides several benefits:
- Data isolation is enforced at a single point rather than scattered throughout the codebase
- Business logic for data access is centralized
- Testing is simplified with clear boundaries
- Consistent error handling across data operations

The main code changes would be in the lib directory, creating repository classes that consume the tenant context and provide type-safe methods for CRUD operations on various collections.
