# Architectural Decisions

**Last Updated:** April 11, 2025

This document records significant architectural decisions made in the project, providing context, rationale, and consequences for each decision.

## Decision-Making Guidelines

### Clean Code Principles Requirement

All architectural decisions must consider Clean Code principles regardless of programming language or framework. These principles include:

1. **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand
2. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
3. **Self-documenting**: Code should explain itself through clear naming and structure
4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication in code and knowledge
5. **SOLID Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Open/Closed Principle  
   - Liskov Substitution Principle
   - Interface Segregation Principle
   - Dependency Inversion Principle
6. **Small Functions/Classes**: Keep functions and classes focused and concise
7. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
8. **Minimal Dependencies**: Limit dependencies between components
9. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and meaningfully
10. **Testability**: Design code to be easily testable

Each architectural decision should explicitly address how it supports or enhances adherence to these principles.

## Decision Record Format

Each architectural decision is documented using the following format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title that summarizes the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The problem or situation that necessitated the decision
4. **Decision**: The specific architectural choice that was made
5. **Consequences**: The resulting outcomes, both positive and negative
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
7. **References**: Any supporting documentation or external influences

## ADR-001: Next.js as the Frontend Framework

### Status
Accepted

### Date
April 05, 2025

### Context
We needed to select a frontend framework for our multi-tenant website engine that would support server-side rendering, static site generation, and efficient client-side operations. The framework must handle routing, data fetching, and rendering efficiently while supporting multiple distinct websites with different styling and content.

### Decision
We decided to adopt Next.js as the frontend framework for the multi-tenant website engine. Next.js provides hybrid rendering options (SSG, SSR, ISR), file-based routing, API routes, built-in optimization, and strong TypeScript support.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Next.js middleware allows interception of requests for tenant identification based on domain
- Flexible rendering options support different performance needs across tenant sites
- Built-in image optimization and performance features benefit all tenants
- Strong community support and comprehensive documentation
- TypeScript integration improves type safety and developer experience

**Negative/Challenges:**
- Team members unfamiliar with Next.js require onboarding
- Some customization needed to support multi-tenant architecture
- Slightly higher learning curve than simpler React frameworks

**Neutral:**
- Regular updates to Next.js require ongoing maintenance
- Need to follow specific patterns for data fetching and routing

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Create React App**:
   - Simpler setup but lacks server-side rendering capabilities
   - No built-in API routes or middleware
   - Rejected due to limited server-side capabilities essential for tenant identification

2. **Gatsby**:
   - Strong static site generation but less flexible for dynamic content
   - More plugin-dependent ecosystem
   - Rejected due to less robust server-rendering options

3. **Remix**:
   - Promising server-side capabilities
   - Newer with smaller community and less proven at scale
   - Rejected due to maturity concerns compared to Next.js

## ADR-002: Firebase Firestore as the Database Solution

### Status
Accepted

### Date
April 06, 2025

### Context
Our multi-tenant website engine requires a database solution that supports:
1. Storing tenant configurations and mappings
2. Content management for multiple tenant sites
3. Efficient querying with tenant-based filtering
4. Scalability to handle growing numbers of tenants and content
5. Real-time capabilities for potential future features

### Decision
We chose Firebase Firestore as our primary database solution for both tenant configuration data and content storage.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- NoSQL document model provides flexibility for varying content structures
- Built-in tenant segregation through collection filtering
- Automatic scaling with no infrastructure management
- Real-time capabilities available when needed
- Seamless integration with other Firebase services

**Negative/Challenges:**
- Requires careful design of security rules to ensure tenant data isolation
- Query complexity with certain compound queries
- Potential cost implications at high scale
- Limited transactional capabilities across collections

**Neutral:**
- Different paradigm from traditional RDBMS requires adjustment
- Data denormalization strategies needed for efficient queries

### Alternatives Considered
1. **PostgreSQL**:
   - Stronger relational capabilities and transactions
   - Would require explicit hosting and scaling solution
   - Rejected due to higher operational overhead and less flexibility for document-style data

2. **MongoDB**:
   - Similar document database capabilities
   - Would require separate hosting
   - Rejected because Firestore offers better integration with other services we need

3. **Firebase Realtime Database**:
   - Simpler model but less sophisticated querying
   - Less scalable for our anticipated needs
   - Rejected due to querying limitations important for tenant filtering

## ADR-003: Domain-Based Tenant Resolution Pattern

### Status
Accepted

### Date
April 08, 2025

### Context
With multiple websites hosted on the same application instance, we needed a robust mechanism to identify which tenant's configuration and content should be served for each incoming request.

### Decision
We've adopted a domain-based tenant resolution pattern implemented through Next.js middleware, where:
1. The incoming request's hostname (domain) is extracted from the HTTP headers
2. The domain is mapped to a tenant configuration using a Firestore lookup (with caching)
3. Tenant context is injected into the request pipeline for use throughout the application
4. All data operations are filtered by the identified tenant ID

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clean separation of tenant data without code duplication
- Simplified hosting with a single application serving multiple sites
- Transparent tenant resolution that works across pages and API routes
- Efficient with local caching to minimize database lookups

**Negative/Challenges:**
- Additional complexity in request processing pipeline
- Cache invalidation challenges when tenant configurations change
- Need for fallback handling for unknown domains

**Neutral:**
- Requires careful testing across various routing scenarios
- DNS configuration becomes a critical part of tenant setup

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Subdomain-based approach**:
   - Using subdomains (tenant1.example.com, tenant2.example.com)
   - Simpler DNS management under a single root domain
   - Rejected because the requirement specified support for completely different domains

2. **Path-based approach**:
   - Using URL paths (/tenant1/*, /tenant2/*) to identify tenants
   - Simpler implementation without domain configuration
   - Rejected as it doesn't provide the distinct website identity required

3. **Separate deployments**:
   - Running a separate instance for each tenant
   - Maximum isolation but defeats the purpose of a multi-tenant system
   - Rejected due to management overhead and resource inefficiency

## ADR-004: CSS Variables for Tenant Theming

### Status
Accepted

### Date
April 09, 2025

### Context
Each tenant website needs distinct visual styling while maintaining a consistent codebase. We needed a theming solution that is:
1. Efficient to implement and maintain
2. Allows complete visual customization per tenant
3. Doesn't increase bundle size significantly for each tenant
4. Can be driven by configuration from Firestore

### Decision
We've chosen to use CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables) as our primary theming mechanism. Theme configurations are stored in Firestore, loaded on tenant identification, and applied as CSS variables to the root element of the application.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clean separation of theme configurations from component logic
- Reduced CSS duplication across themes
- Dynamic theme switching without JavaScript component rerenders
- Styling remains in standard CSS, familiar to all developers

**Negative/Challenges:**
- Requires careful variable naming and organization
- Limited IE11 support (not a concern for our project requirements)
- Need to ensure all styling uses the variables consistently

**Neutral:**
- Developers need to adopt the practice of using variables instead of hard-coded values
- Updates to global theme require careful testing across components

### Alternatives Considered
1. **CSS-in-JS libraries**:
   - More programmatic approach to styling with theme objects
   - Increases bundle size and runtime overhead
   - Rejected due to performance concerns and unnecessary complexity

2. **Separate CSS files per tenant**:
   - Complete isolation of styling
   - Would require managing multiple CSS files and increase maintenance burden
   - Rejected due to duplication and maintenance overhead

3. **Runtime SASS compilation**:
   - Powerful preprocessing capabilities
   - Performance concerns with runtime processing
   - Rejected due to performance impact and complexity

## ADR-005: Local Caching for Tenant Configuration

### Status
Accepted

### Date
April 10, 2025

### Context
Tenant resolution by domain requires a Firestore lookup on each incoming request. With high traffic across multiple tenants, this could lead to:
1. Excessive Firestore reads causing cost concerns
2. Latency in request processing due to database lookups
3. Unnecessary load on the database for unchanging configuration data

### Decision
We've implemented a local in-memory cache using node-cache to store domain-to-tenant mappings with a configurable TTL (Time To Live). The cache is checked before Firestore and refreshed upon cache misses or expirations.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Dramatically reduces Firestore reads for active domains
- Improves response times for repeated requests to the same domain
- Configurable TTL allows balancing freshness and efficiency
- Simple implementation with minimal overhead

**Negative/Challenges:**
- Cache staleness if tenant configurations change during TTL period
- Memory usage increases with number of active domains (though still reasonable)
- Need for cache invalidation mechanism for immediate updates

**Neutral:**
- Separate caches across server instances in scaled deployment
- Requires monitoring to ensure optimal TTL settings

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Redis cache**:
   - External shared cache for multi-instance consistency
   - Adds infrastructure complexity and cost
   - Rejected for initial implementation as local caching is sufficient

2. **No caching**:
   - Always fetch from Firestore
   - Simplest implementation
   - Rejected due to performance and cost implications

3. **Permanent caching with webhooks**:
   - Never expire cache entries, rely on webhooks for invalidation
   - More complex implementation
   - Rejected due to reliability concerns, but may be considered for future optimization
