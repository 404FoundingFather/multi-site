# Product Vision

**Last Updated:** April 11, 2025

This document serves as the source of truth for the product we are building, defining the problem space, solution approach, and user experience goals.

## Problem Statement

* Managing multiple websites requires significant infrastructure overhead and deployment complexity
* Operating separate codebases for similar websites results in duplicated development effort
* Updates and maintenance must be performed individually across multiple sites
* Consistent theming and shared functionality is difficult to maintain across separate websites

## Proposed Solution

* A multi-tenant website engine built on Next.js with Firebase Firestore
* Host multiple distinct websites from a single application instance
* Dynamically serve different websites based on the incoming request's domain name
* Apply tenant-specific configurations, styling, and content
* Utilize a centralized codebase with domain-specific customizations

## User Experience Goals

* Each website should feel like a completely standalone site to end users
* Fast page load times through effective caching and optimized data fetching
* Consistent experience across all tenant sites while maintaining unique branding
* Seamless content delivery with tenant-specific styling and configuration

## Key Features

### Multi-Tenant Routing & Identification
* Domain-based tenant resolution
* Domain-to-site mapping in Firestore
* Local caching for performance optimization
* Proper handling of unknown domains and inactive sites

### Site Configuration
* Structured site configuration in Firestore
* Dynamic configuration loading
* Contextual application throughout request lifecycle

### Theming and Styling
* Tenant-specific visual styles and themes
* Theme configuration in Firestore
* Dynamic theme application

### Content Management
* Tenant-specific data storage and isolation
* Filtered data fetching operations by tenantId

## Target Audience
* Platform Administrators: Technical staff managing tenant sites and configurations
* Site Owners/Managers: Content managers for individual tenant websites
* End Users: Visitors browsing the individual tenant websites

## Success Metrics
* Reduced infrastructure costs compared to hosting separate websites
* Decreased deployment and maintenance time
* Improved page load speed and performance metrics
* Ability to scale to support multiple tenant sites efficiently

## Future Expansion
* Admin dashboard for platform administrators
* Content management interface for site owners
* Support for multiple domains per tenant
* More advanced theming options
* Third-party service integrations configurable per tenant
* Analytics tracking per tenant

## Constraints
* Must be built using Next.js as the frontend framework
* Must use Firebase Firestore for configuration and data storage
* Must support distinct visual styling for each tenant
* Must ensure data isolation between tenants
