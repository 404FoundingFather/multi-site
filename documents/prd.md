Product Requirements Document (PRD): Multi-Tenant Website Engine

Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-04-11

1. Introduction / Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-tenant website engine. The core purpose of this engine is to host and serve multiple distinct websites from a single Next.js application instance, leveraging Firebase Firestore for configuration and data storage. The system will dynamically determine which website ("tenant") to serve based on the incoming request's domain name, applying tenant-specific configurations, styling, and content. This approach aims to reduce infrastructure overhead, streamline deployment, and simplify the management of multiple web properties.

2. Goals & Objectives

Primary Goal: Enable the hosting of multiple independent websites (tenants) from a single codebase and server deployment.
Scalability: Design the system to handle a growing number of tenant sites and increasing traffic loads efficiently.
Customization: Allow each tenant site to have unique styling, configuration, and content.
Performance: Ensure fast request processing and page load times, utilizing caching mechanisms effectively.
Maintainability: Build a modular and well-structured application that is easy to update and maintain.
Configuration Driven: Utilize Firestore as the primary source for site configurations, allowing dynamic updates without redeployment (where feasible).

3. Target Audience

Platform Administrators: Individuals responsible for setting up new tenant sites, managing global configurations, monitoring the system, and deploying updates.
(Potentially) Site Owners/Managers: Individuals responsible for managing the content and specific settings of their individual tenant website (depending on future admin interface scope).
End Users: Visitors Browse the individual websites hosted by the engine.

4. Functional Requirements

4.1. Multi-Tenant Routing & Identification

FR1.1 Domain-Based Tenant Resolution: The system MUST identify the target tenant site based on the Host header (domain name) of the incoming HTTP request.

FR1.2 Domain-to-Site Mapping:
A mechanism MUST exist (primarily in Firestore) to map domain names (e.g., mycats.com, homefurniture.com) to unique tenant identifiers or configurations.
This mapping configuration MUST be stored in Firestore (e.g., in a sites or tenants collection).

FR1.3 Local Caching:
The system MUST maintain a local, in-memory cache mapping domain names to their corresponding tenant configurations/IDs.
This cache is intended to minimize Firestore lookups on frequent requests for the same domain, improving performance.
The cache MUST have a configurable Time-To-Live (TTL).
A mechanism for cache invalidation MUST be considered (e.g., periodic refresh, triggered updates).

FR1.4 Handling Unknown Domains: If a request arrives for a domain not configured in the system (or cache), the system MUST return an appropriate response (e.g., a standard 404 page, a specific "domain not found" page, or redirect to a default landing page).

FR1.5 Handling Inactive Sites: The configuration for a site MUST allow marking it as "inactive". Requests for inactive sites should result in a specific response (e.g., a "Site unavailable" page).

4.2. Site Controllers / Configuration Loading

FR2.1 Site Configuration Structure: Each tenant site MUST have a corresponding configuration document stored in Firestore. This document should contain (at minimum):
tenantId (Unique identifier)
domainName (Primary domain for mapping)
siteName (Display name)
themeId or styleConfig (Reference to styling information)
status (e.g., active, inactive)
Other site-specific settings (e.g., logo URL, contact info, feature flags, potentially API keys - consider security implications).

FR2.2 Dynamic Configuration Loading: Upon identifying the tenant via the domain, the system MUST load the corresponding site configuration from Firestore (checking the cache first).

FR2.3 Contextual Application: The loaded configuration ("Site Controller" context) MUST be available throughout the request lifecycle (e.g., in Next.js getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, API routes, and React components) to influence rendering, data fetching, and behavior.
4.3. Theming and Styling

FR3.1 Tenant-Specific Styling: The engine MUST support applying distinct visual styles (themes) to different tenant sites.

FR3.2 Theme Configuration: A mechanism MUST exist (likely in Firestore, e.g., a themes collection) to define different themes. Themes could define:
CSS Variables (colors, fonts, spacing)
Component-level style overrides
References to specific CSS files or modules.

FR3.3 Dynamic Theme Application: The system MUST apply the correct theme based on the themeId or styleConfig specified in the loaded site configuration.

4.4. Content Management

FR4.1 Tenant-Specific Data: Data stored in Firestore (e.g., pages, blog posts, products) MUST be associated with a specific tenantId.

FR4.2 Data Fetching: All data fetching operations within the Next.js application MUST be filtered by the tenantId corresponding to the current request's site context. This ensures data isolation between tenants.

4.5. Core Technology

FR5.1 Frontend Framework: The application MUST be built using Next.js.

FR5.2 Backend Database: Firebase Firestore MUST be used for storing site configurations, themes, and tenant-specific content/data.
5. Non-Functional Requirements

NF1. Performance:

Domain Lookup: Cached domain lookups should be near-instantaneous (< 10ms). Uncached lookups should be optimized (< 100ms target).
Page Load Speed: Adhere to good web performance practices (e.g., Core Web Vitals). Leverage Next.js features (SSR, ISR, SSG) appropriately per tenant/page type.

NF2. Scalability:

The system should scale horizontally to handle increased traffic by running multiple instances of the Next.js server.
Firestore provides inherent scalability for the database layer.
Consider potential Firestore read/write limits under heavy load across many tenants.

NF3. Reliability:

The engine should be highly available. Implement robust error handling for database connection issues, configuration errors, etc.

NF4. Security:

Data Isolation: Implement strict Firestore Security Rules to prevent tenants from accessing each other's data.
Configuration Security: Protect access to the site configuration data in Firestore.
Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all inputs.
Dependency Management: Keep dependencies up-to-date.

NF5. Maintainability: 

Code should be modular, well-documented, and follow consistent coding standards. The separation of concerns between the core engine and tenant-specific logic/configuration should be clear.
NF6. Manageability: Provide a clear way (initially, potentially manual Firestore edits or a script) for Platform Administrators to add, configure, and disable tenant sites.

6. Technical Architecture Outline

Request Flow:
Incoming Request (e.g., https://mycats.com/products)
Next.js Middleware or Server Entry Point intercepts the request.
Extract Host header (mycats.com).
Check local cache for mycats.com.
Cache Miss: Query Firestore sites collection for document where domainName == 'mycats.com'.
Cache Hit or Firestore Success: Retrieve tenantId and siteConfig.
Store mapping in cache if retrieved from Firestore.
Inject tenantId and siteConfig into request context (e.g., using React Context API provider at the _app.js level, or passing down through props).
Next.js renders the appropriate page (/products).
Data fetching functions (getServerSideProps, etc.) use the tenantId from context to query Firestore for relevant data (e.g., products for mycats.com).
Components use siteConfig for theming (CSS variables, conditional styling) and displaying site-specific info (name, logo).
Page is rendered and returned.

Key Components:
Next.js Application
Firebase Firestore Database
Tenant Resolution Middleware/Logic
Local Caching Mechanism (e.g., node-cache or a simple object store)
Firestore Data Access Layer (with tenant filtering)
Theming System (e.g., CSS Variables provider)

7. Data Model Sketch (Firestore)

sites collection:
Document ID: Auto-ID or tenantId
Fields: tenantId (string), domainName (string, indexed), siteName (string), themeId (string), status (string: 'active' | 'inactive'), config (map/object for other settings), createdAt, updatedAt (timestamps).
themes collection:
Document ID: themeId
Fields: name (string), styles (map/object containing CSS variables, font URLs, etc.).
pages_ (Example Content Collection):
Document ID: Auto-ID or page slug
Fields: tenantId (string, indexed), slug (string), title (string), content (string/map), createdAt, updatedAt. (Note: tenantId is crucial here for data separation).
(Similar structure for other content types like posts_, products_, etc.)

8. User Roles & Permissions (Initial)

Platform Administrator: Full read/write access to sites and themes collections in Firestore. Ability to deploy application updates.
System (Next.js Server): Read access to sites and themes. Read/Write access to content collections (pages_, products_, etc.) based on authenticated user roles if user editing features are implemented later. Crucially, Firestore rules must enforce that server operations are always filtered by the correct tenantId.

9. Open Questions / Areas for Clarification

"Site Controller" Definition: Is it purely configuration fetched from Firestore, or does it imply loading different code modules/components based on the tenant? (Assuming config-only for v1.0 for simplicity).
Theme Complexity: How sophisticated does the theming need to be? (Simple CSS variables, full CSS file switching, component overrides?)
Admin Interface: Is a dedicated admin UI required for Platform Admins or Site Owners, or will Firestore console/scripts suffice initially?
Cache Invalidation Strategy: How critical is real-time updating of the domain cache? (e.g., If a domain is added/changed in Firestore, how quickly must the running server instances pick it up? Simple TTL expiration, Firestore Functions trigger, manual API call?)
Content Structure: What specific types of content need to be supported per site (e.g., basic pages, blog, e-commerce products)? This impacts the Firestore data model.
Deployment Strategy: Where will this be hosted? (Vercel, Google Cloud Run, etc.) How will custom domains be pointed to the single instance/load balancer?
Error Handling Specifics: Define specific user-facing messages for "Domain Not Found" and "Site Inactive".

10. Future Considerations / Roadmap Ideas

Tenant-specific feature flags.
Admin dashboard for platform admins.
(Optional) Admin dashboard for site owners/managers to manage their own content.
Support for multiple domains per tenant site.
More advanced theming options.
Integration with third-party services configurable per tenant.
Analytics tracking per tenant.
